# SHOWTIME

  In this project, I have made a website which fetches data from an API and lists the shows mentioned in the API after clicking on the card the details of the show are provided      with an option of booking a ticket for that show.

  I have used ReactJS for the front end and react-router-dom for routing purposes along the different web pages.
